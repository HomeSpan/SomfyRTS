# SomfyRTS
 A universal, multi-channel, HomeKit Controller for Somfy RTS Motorized Window Shades and Patio Screens. Runs on an ESP32 device as an Arduino sketch using the Arduino [HomeSpan Library](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan).

Hardware used for this project:

* An ESP32 board, such as the [Adafruit HUZZAH32 â€“ ESP32 Feather Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405)
* An RFM69 Transceiver, such as this [RFM69HCW FeatherWing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10534) from Adafruit
* One small pushbutton (normally-open) to serve as both the Somfy PROG button and the channel selector button
* Three large pushbuttons (normally-open) to serve as the Somfy UP, DOWN, and MY buttons.
* One small pushbutton (normally-open) to serve as the HomeSpan Control Button (optional)

# Overview

Somfy motors are widely used in automated window shades, patios screens, and porch awnings.  And though there are many different models, almost all are controlled with a standardized system Somfy calls RTS, or [Radio Technology Somfy](https://asset.somfy.com/Document/dcb579ff-df8d-47d8-a288-01e06a4480ab_RTS_Brochure_5-2019.pdf) using Somfy RF controllers, such as the 5-channel [Somfy Tellis RTS](https://www.somfysystems.com/en-us/products/1810633/telis-rts).

All Somfy remotes feature:

* an UP button that typically raises the window shade or screen until it is fully opened;
* a DOWN buttonthat typicall lowers the window shade or screen until it is fully closed;
* a button labeled "MY" that serves two purposes - 
  * if the shade is moving, pressing the MY button stops the motor
  * if the shade it stopped, pressing the MY button moves the shade to a predefined position (the "MY" position)
* a PROG button that is used to put the motor into programming mode or "learn" mode so you can add additional remotes; and
* a channel selector, for remotes that allow the user to control more than one shade or screen from one remote.

Based on the **superb** work by [Pushstack](https://pushstack.wordpress.com/somfy-rts-protocol/) and other contributors for reverse-engineering and documenting the Somfy-RTS protcols (much thanks!), we can construct a HomeKit-enabled, fully-functional, multi-channel Somfy remote using an ESP32, a simple transmitter, and the Arduino HomeSpan Library.
